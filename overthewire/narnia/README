* narnia0 -> narnia1
  While it seemed easy in the beginning, my lack of understanding of the
details was my downfall. I saw that there was a buffer overflow immediately,
got the code to execute as expected, but was completely unaware of how to pass
all of the desired code to the program in a single string. Even after that
simple part, I didn't notice that a terminal had popped up, and even more, was
unable to keep the terminal after it opened, and even after I had seen the
solution, I was not able to tell why it worked. However, now I know to be
careful with which statements I put semicolons after since that ends the
command right there. 
  pass=efeidiedae
* narnia1 -> narnia2
  Seems like this next one will be hard as well, oh well.
