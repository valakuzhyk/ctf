In this problem, they made you think about how the stack was organized, and instead of trying to overwrite the return address, you just overwrite the key.

If you know the key needs to be overwritten, you can just calculate the amount on the stack you need to adjust. 


Was able to use cyclic to find the offset (kinda), gdb and other python pwntools kinda stuff.
However, it was really helpful to watch someone else do it, was able to pick on lots of things that I need to be doing too.
